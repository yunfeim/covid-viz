# About

Existing visualizations for the spread of COVID-19 through the United States
generally fall into two categories: those that show the geographic distribution
of the virus at a particular time and those that show the temporal trend
of the virus at a particular location.

This app combines both approaches by creating a dynamic visualization of
the distribution of the virus over time in the United States.
Furthermore, it provides the user with many options to customize
what is presented.
